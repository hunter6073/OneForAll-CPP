* Project: Relearn C++ in an hour

* Author: Ted Wong(Hechun Wang)

* Description: this project is to help programmers with former knowledge with C++ relearn the essentials 
* in a short amount of time. There are currently around 1000 lines of code to cover the essentials.
* the contents of this script covers the following:

* 1. C++ Core Basics
* 2. C++ Pointers
* 3. C++ Class
* 4. C++ Exception
* 5. C++ Streams
* 6. C++ File I/O

* Note: this project is created using visual studio 2019 on windows, you can import this project 
* and run it to see the results. If you choose to use a different IDE or use 
* linux system to compile this program, then please change the headers accordingly to avoid errors

* Another note is all essential features are commented with keywords, so if you need to look at an example for
* a specific feature, such as 'virtual functions' or 'polymorphism', perform keyword search for their examples
* (This is not yet fully implemented)

* The code are originally from "C++: The complete reference, fourth edition" by Herbert Schildt, all outputs are labelled with
* unique index for code searching

* Progress:
* Next step is to add in keywords for easy searching



Have fun with the script, hope it helps in any way possible!
Best,
Ted
