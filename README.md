# SimpleLearnCPP
 
* Project: Relearn C++ in an hour

* Author: Ted Wong(Hechun Wang)

* Description: this project is to help programmers with former knowledge with C++ relearn the essentials 
* in a short amount of time. There are currently around 1000 lines of code to cover the essentials.
* the contents of this script covers the following:

* 1. C++ Core Basics
* 2. C++ Pointers
* 3. C++ Class
* 4. C++ Exception
* 5. C++ Streams
* 6. C++ File I/O

* How to use this project:
* 1. Simply download or clone this repository and open the CPP_Project.sln file using visual studio, if you're using linux system or other
* IDEs on windows or mac, go into the CPP_Project folder and start assemble the cpp code for build and run. Also note that some libraries
* used are on windows only such as <winsock>. Change these libraries accordingly to run the code(will be updated soon to fit all systems).
* 2. Look into CPP_Project.cpp script, this is the entry code containing all other feature scripts.
* 3. Run build on the script to see the output, you can match all instances of output with their implementation code via the unique index
* for each output


* Note: this project is created using visual studio 2019 on windows, you can import this project 
* and run it to see the results. If you choose to use a different IDE or use 
* linux system to compile this program, then please change the headers accordingly to avoid errors

* Another note is all essential features are commented with keywords, so if you need to look at an example for
* a specific feature, such as 'virtual functions' or 'polymorphism', perform keyword search for their examples
* (This is not yet fully implemented)

* The code are originally from "C++: The complete reference, fourth edition" by Herbert Schildt, all outputs are labelled with
* unique index for code searching

* Progress:
* Next step is to add in keywords for easy searching



Have fun with the script, hope it helps in any way possible!
Best,
Ted
