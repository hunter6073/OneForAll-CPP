# One For All - C++
 
* Project: One kit for all projects - c++ version

* Author: Ted Wong(Hechun Wang)

* Description: 
Ever find yourself ready to create a project and having to find the bits and pieces of code from the internet? And even then
the code might not work due to configurations? 
Well fret no more, for here is the One For All project! 
In this file is a fully built c++ demo project with no extra coniguration needed. 
Simply download or clone this repository and open the CPP_Project.sln file using visual studio on windows. Run the script to see the output of all instances. 
IT WILL JUST WORK!

* Contents:
    1. C++ Core Basics
    2. C++ Pointers
    3. C++ Class
    4. C++ Exception
    5. C++ Streams
    6. C++ File I/O
    7. C++ Threads
    8. C++ socket programming in windows

* Simple Tips:
    1. Run the program to make sure everything works. If there is an error then throw this project away, it's garbage unless it just works
    2. The entrance code containing each part is the "CPP_Project.cpp" script, it's very simplified, so you can use it as an index.
    3. Search for what you need in the respective script, you can do keyword search or simply scroll into the feature function to check everything
    4. You can match the output with the original code via the unique output indexes

* Note: 
This project is created using visual studio 2019 on windows. 
If you choose to use a different IDE or use linux system to compile this program, 
then please change the headers accordingly to avoid errors. 
A suitable version for other operating systems is being developed underway.

The code are originally from "C++: The complete reference, fourth edition" by Herbert Schildt and some are from microsoft's winsocket documentation.

* Progress:
Next step is to add in keywords for easy searching and perhaps try a python version? Or maybe java?

Have fun with the script, hope it helps in any way possible.
ONE FOR ALL, ALL FOR ONE!
Ted
